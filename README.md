=======================================

What's Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a personal data platform that brings all your web services in the same private space. With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

What is this konnector about ?
------------------------------

This konnector retrieves your banking data (cards and operations) from your Edenred account.

**It must be ran locally, using `yarn dev` and a JSON file as specified below. This is due to Edenred not providing a proper way to access its systems through its API.**

**Edenred's ToS forbid the use of automated tools to access their services. Use this konnector at your own risk.**

### Run and test

Create a `konnector-dev-config.json` file at the root with your test credentials :

```javascript
{
  "COZY_URL": "http://cozy.tools:8080",
  "fields": {"login":"zuck.m@rk.fb", "password":"123456"}
}
```
Then :

```sh
yarn
yarn standalone
```
For running the konnector connected to a Cozy server and more details see [konnectors tutorial](https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/konnector/)

If everything works, you can run `yarn dev`.

### Cozy-konnector-libs

This connector uses [cozy-konnector-libs](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-konnector-libs). It brings a bunch of helpers to interact with the Cozy server and to fetch data from an online service.
